*DESCRIPTION*: I developed and enhanced a Sorting Algorithm Visualization project that aimed to create an interactive and educational platform for understanding how sorting algorithms work internally, step by step. The project was built using TypeScript and modern frontend development tools, and I contributed specifically to implementing and refining algorithms like Bubble Sort and Merge Sort within files such as quick.ts. Merge Sort was implemented using a recursive divide-and-conquer approach, paired with asynchronous generator functions to control execution flow, allowing each intermediate step to be visually rendered in real-time for better comprehension. The project used specialized helper methods like highlight, move, and sort from @sortViz/helpers/algorithm-helpers to not only manipulate array data but also trigger animations in the visualization UI, providing a highly intuitive experience for the user. My key work involved integrating performance measurement features by introducing console.time and console.timeEnd in strategic parts of the sorting logic to track execution time precisely, excluding artificial delays caused by animations. This enhancement allowed the visualizer to not only demonstrate the sorting process visually but also give factual data on how fast each algorithm executed, helping compare algorithmic efficiency. After implementing these improvements, I rebuilt the project using commands like yarn dev for development mode and yarn build && yarn start for production, ensuring that changes reflected seamlessly. In the process, I gained extensive experience in working with asynchronous programming patterns, modular code structures, and UI-triggered logical operations. Additionally, I learned the importance of performance optimization in user-facing applications, especially when combining computation with animation. This project was not just about coding sorting algorithmsâ€”it was about bridging the gap between abstract computational logic and tangible, understandable learning tools. It improved my problem-solving skills, deepened my understanding of algorithm complexities, and strengthened my ability to work with TypeScript in an environment that demanded both accuracy and efficiency. Ultimately, it was a rewarding experience that showcased the intersection of algorithms, performance analysis, and interactive visualization in a single cohesive application.
